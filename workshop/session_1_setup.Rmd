We start by installing some packages we'll need.

We are going to be doing some data wrangling (`tidyverse`).

```{r install1,echo = TRUE}

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("devtools")

```

We will also be using the `collaborator`package, but it is only on GitHub at present (looking to make it avaiable on R repositories soon)
```{r install2,echo = TRUE}
devtools::install_github("kamclean/collaborator")
```
